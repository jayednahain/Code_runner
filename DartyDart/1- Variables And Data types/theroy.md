# final variables:
- A final variable can only be set once.
It is initialized when it is accessed at runtime, meaning that its value doesn't need to be known at compile time.

# const variables:
- A const variable is a compile-time constant, meaning its value is fixed and must be known before the program runs (at compile time).
- It is initialized at compile time and cannot depend on anything that happens during runtime.


# Late
late keyword is used to indicate that a non-nullable variable will be initialized later in the code.
