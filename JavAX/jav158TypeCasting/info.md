# type casting
- convert a data to a different data

## primitive data type casting
#### implicit type casting
```java
public class mainTest {
    int x = 10;
    double y = x;
}
```
- byte -> short -> int -> long -> float -> double 
- moving to more left it takes more memory space 
- this process in told as **widening**

#### explicit type casting
- double -> float -> long -> int -> short -> byte
- this process in called **narrowing**


## Non - primitive data type casting (object type casting)
- put one class object to another class object
### there are two type of object type casting
- Upcasting
- Downcasting

## Upcasting
- put subclass object inside super class object
