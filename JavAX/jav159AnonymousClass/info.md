# Anonymous class
- Anonymous class does not have any name
- used to instantiate one object
- same time we create object and define class
- it cant extend or implements
- 


# why we use Anonymous class?
- during runtime we want to override a class method / interface method
 - When you want to override a method, you typically need to extend the class that contains that method. Instead of defining a separate subclass explicitly, you can use an anonymous class to extend the class and override the method in one step.
